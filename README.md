Fine-Tuning the Model
The model is initially set up to use GPT-2, but you can switch to GPT-4 by modifying the model loading section in the code. Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to the GPT-4 model.

To fine-tune the model, ensure that your dataset is formatted correctly and follow these steps in the app.py file:

Load your dataset with the load_custom_dataset function.
Tokenize the dataset.
Fine-tune the model using the fine_tune_model function.
Evaluation
The application includes evaluation functionality that provides feedback on the model's performance. You can check the logs for evaluation results after training.
